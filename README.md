# task-board

## Description
We were tasked with creating a todo list/kaban board that is interactive.  After entering the information in the modal form,the information is stored in local storage and the task is displayed in the designated columns and can be dragged and drop for ease of use.  If something is due today its yellow, if its past due its red, and if it isnt due yet, it appears white.  The task boxes also can appear white once dragged and dropped into the done column. 

## Methods
For this project we utilized Day.js, jquery, and bootstrap.

## Usage
Upon opening the page the user is to click the "add task" button and enter the required information to make a to-do list.  The boxes (widgets) are created and put into the to-do column and are color coded by how near the due date it is.  Yellow means its due today, white means its not due yet, and red means its past due.  The user can drag and drop the widgets into the in progress and done columns.  Once the widgets are placed into the done column, they will appear white.
